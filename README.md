# MIR_toolbox
Matlab toolbox for the estimation of the Mutual Information Rate (MIR) and of the complexity and causality measures in which it can be decomposed. This toolbox allows for computing these information terms by using several estimation approaches, i.e., linear parametric, nearest neighbor, binning and permutation.
